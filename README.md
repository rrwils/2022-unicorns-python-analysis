This is a research report using Python on Jupyter Notebook, which examines if unicorns are concentrated in specific industries or nations, and whether unicorns from different nations typically specialise in different markets. In addition, I examined the top 10 investors to see whether any of them had a tendency to specialise in any particular nations or industries. Lastly, I made a time series to illustrate which sectors  have witnessed comparatively faster unicorn growth in recent years.

I used [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies) dataset (as of 2022) for the analysis.

This repository contains the Notebook and the dataset in Excel format.
